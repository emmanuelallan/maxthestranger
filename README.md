ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Emmanuel Allan

- ðŸŽ“ Final year Computer Science student at [`Chuka University`](https://www.chuka.ac.ke/) with a passion for technology and creative problem-solving.

I've honed my skills through [`academic projects`](https://code.maxthestranger.com/projects#academic/), [`freelance work`](https://code.maxthestranger.com/projects#freelance/), and [`personal initiatives`](https://code.maxthestranger.com/projects#personal/), constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow.
- ðŸŽµ When I'm not coding, you'll find me making [`music`](https://music.maxthestranger.com/) and exploring the intersection of art and technology. I'm also enthusiastic about [`content creation`](https://www.youtube.com/@maxthestranger) and love sharing my experiences through various mediums.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on expanding my freelancing career, taking on exciting projects that challenge me and push the boundaries of what's possible. If you're looking for a dedicated and innovative developer, I'd love to hear from you!
- âœ¨ My GitHub repositories showcase a range of projects that reflect my technical expertise and creativity. Whether it's building web/mobile applications, implementing algorithms, or experimenting with new technologies, I enjoy turning ideas into functional and impactful solutions.

- ðŸŒŸ Let's connect! Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities, open-source projects, or to discuss anything tech-related. I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and contribute to the tech community.
